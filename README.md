# Car-price-Analysis-And-Prediction

## Overview
This project involves analyzing car datasets to develop a predictive model for estimating vehicle prices. The system leverages machine learning algorithms to identify key factors influencing car prices and provides accurate predictions based on these features.

## Project Workflow
Data Collection: The car dataset is preprocessed to ensure data quality and consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Key insights are derived from the dataset, including trends and correlations.
Feature Engineering: Important features affecting car prices, such as brand, year, mileage, and engine type, are selected.

Model Training: Machine learning algorithms are used to train the model on the processed dataset.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and RÂ² score.
Deployment: The trained model is ready for integration into applications for car price prediction.

## Features
Predicts car prices based on input features such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition.
Provides data insights through exploratory analysis.
Highly accurate predictions achieved through model optimization.

## Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis and model training.
Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For model training and evaluation.
